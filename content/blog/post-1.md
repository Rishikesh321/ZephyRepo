Much like the tidyverse consists of many core packages, such as ggplot2 and dplyr, tidymodels also consists of several core packages, including

1. rsample: for sample splitting (e.g. train/test or cross-validation)

2. recipes: for pre-processing

3. parsnip: for specifying the model

4. yardstick: for evaluating the model

Similarly to how you can load the entire tidyverse suite of packages by typing library(tidyverse), you can load the entire tidymodels suite of packages by typing library(tidymodels).

We will also be using the tune package (for parameter tuning procedure) and the workflows package (for putting everything together) that I had thought were a part of CRAN's tidymodels package bundle, but apparently they aren't. These will need to be loaded separately for now.
