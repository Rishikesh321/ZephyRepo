I've worked with various types of projects and have mastered R programming languages and Python as well as data scientist and web application developer in Rshiny.
I have to understand the business problem, and according to that I made visualization and create statistical models to clarify that problem.
I also work with shiny dashboard and create web applications, on which i use predictive models in background.</p>
Presently, I am working with Human resource data in which I have to create an application which will round wise predict how many candidates will clear the round.
